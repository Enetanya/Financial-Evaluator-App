This app is a financial evaluator application built using HTML, CSS and React.js. It allows users to input their monthly expenses, including various categories such as rent, groceries, and entertainment. The app calculates the total expenses and the remaining balance after subtracting expenses from the monthly income. Based on the remaining balance, it provides financial advice categorized into different levels, from "Congratulations" for a healthy financial position to advice for those facing financial challenges.

Key components of the app include:
1. `ExpenseSelection`: Allows users to select their monthly expenses by checking checkboxes and submit their choices.
2. `ExpenseInput`: Provides input fields for users to enter their monthly net income and the amounts for selected expenses.
3. `ExpenseCalculator`: Calculates and displays total expenses, remaining balance, and a percentage of savings based on user inputs.
4. `SavingsAdvice`: Provides financial advice based on the percentage of savings.
5. `App`: The main component that controls the rendering of the other components based on user interactions.
6. CSS styles for styling the user interface.

The app appears to be focused on helping users assess their financial situation, make budgeting decisions, and receive personalized financial advice based on their inputs. Users can toggle the rendering of these financial assessment components on and off using buttons.
